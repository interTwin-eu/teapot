    <p>
        Teapot is open-source software that allows HTTP/WebDAV access to your
        existing storage. It supports multi-tenancy and it's based on StoRM-WebDAV.
        We have added a manager level that accepts requests, authenticates the user,
        identifies the local username of the user, starts a StoRM-WebDAV server for
        that local user with a randomly assigned port to listen on, and forwards the
        user's request to that port. The StoRM-WebDAV server will then handle the
        request in the usual way. If the StoRM-WebDAV server is inactive for 10 minutes,
        it will be shut down by the manager. If another request comes in or a different
        user, the manager will start another StoRM-WebDAV server for that user in the same
        way.

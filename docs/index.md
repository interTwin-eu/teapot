**Teapot** is open-source software that provides HTTP/WebDAV access to existing
storage systems. It supports multi-tenancy by dynamically launching
user-specific StoRM-WebDAV instances on demand.

Teapot is ideal for environments where fine-grained, user-isolated access to
storage is needed—such as in grid computing, research infrastructure, or
institutional data platforms.

## Features

- WebDAV and HTTP access to existing storage
- Multi-user support with per-user StoRM-WebDAV instances
- Automatic launch and shutdown of StoRM-WebDAV servers
- Identity mapping via file-based, ALISE, or VO-based methods
- Encrypted communication between components

# Teapot

This application provides a WebDAV that supports multi-tenancy. It is based on
[StoRM-WebDAV](https://github.com/italiangrid/storm-webdav). We have added a
manager level that accepts requests, authenticates the user, identifies the
local username of the user, starts a StoRM-WebDAV server for that local user
with a randomly assigned port to listen on, and forwards the user's request to
that port. The StoRM-WebDAV server will then handle the request in the usual
way. If the StoRM-WebDAV server is inactive for 10 minutes, it will be shut down
by the manager. If another request comes in for a different user, the manager
will start another StoRM-WebDAV server for that user in the same way.
